Ukato is a simple command-line application for creating and managing notes using your favorite text editor. It provides an easy way to organize your notes and templates efficiently.

Also, in the endangered Kwazinian language of the people of Rond√¥nia, Brazil, 'Ukato' is the word for the [Rusty tree frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_tree_frog).

We are Rust noobs on our way to become full fledged, coconut-oiled, blue-haired Rustaceans, so contributions to Ukato are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Next steps

- Implement a category system using YAML frontmatter so that notes can be organised into categories
- Support more editors, currently we only tested with vim
- Improve error handling
- Split functionality into modules
